# RockPaperScissor_game-Python-
Rock Paper Scissors is a traditional game played by children.I have tried to make a similar game with computer as your opponent using Python's "random" library.This is just a simple game, genereting random values and then comparing it with user given input and then deciding the win based on the two inputs,one from the user and other from the random library.
